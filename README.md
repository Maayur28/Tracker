## About The Project

![HomePage](https://res.cloudinary.com/mayur28/image/upload/v1638013338/PriceTrackerHomePage_flgfes.png)

As you have already know from my [portfolio](https://www.mayuragarwal.in/) that my focussed is on creating the user-friendly websites that deliver over the top experience. It delivers clean and easy-to-use user-experience with excellent responsiveness. Some major takeout from the project:

- You need to provide product url and notified when the price drops below the desired price.
- It helps you to track your favourite product in realtime.
- Click on Add tracking button and provide url and desired price for that product.
- You can also view all your trackings by clicking on View Tracking button.
